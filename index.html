        <p>As a 300 level Computer Science student who initially had no knowledge prior to Tech (Web Development). It all started in my 200 level when I met people of like minds and goals. People who tagged me along in whatever they were doing relating to tech and guide me through it. I can't literally talk about my tech journey without mentioning their names - Bruce, Uche, Elo and Emperor. I am at this stage in my learning today, all thanks to them. As time went by, I participated in a 30 days, 100 days and currently in a 200 days coding challenge organized by a friend to mine and so far worked on a series of projects.<br>
          <br>
        
        Right now, I am an IT student at the Enugu State Tech Hub and a proud participant of the Genesys Upskill Program.</p>
